# Stirling-Engine-Analysis
# This code deals with the analysis of Stirling Engine. 
# A Stirling Engine is characterized by two sets of slider-crank linkages placed perpendicular to each other.
# The code takes the length of connecting rod, crank radius and angular velocity of crank as input and creates a dataframe containing velocity and acceleration of the piston and connecting rod of the two slider-crank linkages at each angle (theta).
# The data can then be pulled to create plots using matplotlib
